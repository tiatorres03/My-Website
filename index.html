    <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>My name is Tia Torres and I am currently a sophomore at Licking Heights. Most of my time at school, when I'm not doing my work I like to spill all the tea or in other words gossip about everything going on in the school.In my time here at Licking Heights we has never really had a good name for itself.We always have police here, there is always fights,and just a whole bunch of unnnecessary drama.Also Licking Heights is getting new rules </p>
