    <h2>About Me</h2>
         <p>My name is Tia Torres and I am currently a sophomore at Licking Heights. To tell you a little more about me, I play basketball for the school and a travel team,I also like to sleep, but it's hard doing both!But besides that, most of my time at school, when I'm not doing my work I like to spill all the tea or in other words gossip about everything going on in the school.In my time here at Licking Heights we have never really had a good name for ourself.We always have fights,and there is just a whole bunch of unnnecessary drama. For example when people ask me what school I go to, and I tell them they are like "ew,you go there".Also Licking Heights is starting to getting new rules. </p>
